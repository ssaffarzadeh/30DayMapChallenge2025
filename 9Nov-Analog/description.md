# Day 9: Analog

M(ap), or M analog plot

## Content Description

This is a completely useless map (arguably not even a map) that demonstrates how simple a plot using sf and ggplot2 is. All "data", "code" and "output" come from my toddler’s toy stash—which at this point gets almost as much use as my R console.

## Process Description

Having to find physical objects that meaningfully represent elements of both the plot and the code was a big challenge. Finding the number "1" to index the data was by far the most difficult part, but I am proud of the solution I found.

## Data Sources

Toddler toy box—unfortunately the data cannot be shared, so the output is not reproducible.
