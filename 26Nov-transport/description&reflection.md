**Description of the map**
Located at the edge of the European continent, facing the Atlantic Ocean and home to the largest international port in Europe, the Netherlands serves as a gateway for European imports in the era of globalization. This map illustrates the country’s water transportation routes, with dashed lines representing sea routes and solid lines indicating inland waterways. It clearly shows that the sea routes converge at two major ports: Rotterdam and Amsterdam.

Inland, the waterway network is noticeably denser in the western part of the country, with several main waterways extending into neighboring nations. The map primarily focuses on depicting the waterway network, omitting most general topographic details. However, due to data limitations, it may be somewhat misleading—since not all inland waterways are suitable for freight transport. For instance, the canals in central Amsterdam are clearly not designed for this purpose.


**Reflection**
This map primarily uses vector data, for which the sf and ggplot2 packages in R prove to be highly effective tools. Before implementing the workflow in code, I first experimented with similar processes in QGIS and FME. By comparison, I found that sf provides all the necessary geometric operations while requiring significantly less processing time than QGIS. In addition, since ggplot2 allows flexible control over visualization, the overall workflow in R is also more efficient than that in FME.
One major challenge I encountered during the coding process was related to data quality. Although object attributes can be inspected directly in R, it is often necessary to visually examine the data to determine the appropriate operations. For example, national borders are defined differently across data sources, and such semantic inconsistencies can strongly affect geometric operations. Moreover, missing attributes, such as information on the accessibility or classification of waterways, pose a fundamental limitation for creating accurate and meaningful maps.
