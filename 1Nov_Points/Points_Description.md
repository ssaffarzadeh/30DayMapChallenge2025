Day 1 - Points: Pigeons, beware! 1km around distributors of contraceptive seeds in the City of Brussels
By Clémentine Cottineau-Mugadza

**Content Description**
This map represents the location of distributors of contraceptive seeds for pigeons in the City of Brussels. Each white dot corresponds to a distributor and the circular surfaces represent 1km buffers around them. The map reveals the uneven spatial distribution of actions taken by the City of Brussels to control the pigeon population, which concentrates in the city centre (Pentagone, Louise, Nord-Est) and North of the municipality. The data comes from the data management team of Ville de Bruxelles and is released on its open data plateform. 


**Process Description**
To make this map, I had to create buffers around the point data, fuse the contiguous ones into single polygons. I intersected these fused buffers with the administrative boundaries of the city of Brussels to visualise the fact that information is restricted to the central municipality of the belgian capital region (the relevant functional unit for context mapping). By doing this, I used all of the GIS functions described in episode 16 of the Geospatial Carpentries for Urbanism: .
