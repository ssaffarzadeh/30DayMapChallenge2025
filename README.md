# 30DayMapChallenge2025

The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is an event which gathers mappers on social media each November since 2019. The challenge is to produce a map for each of the 30 days of November, following the set of themes / topics / constraints set by the organisers.

This year again, we participate as a group to the #30DayMapChallenge. Given the focus of the Rbanism community on the programming language R, we create each map with R.


## Guidelines for submission
1. Create the **map** you were assigned for, which contains:
    1) **a map made with R**,
    2) **a title** (on the format “*challengedate_challengetopic: subtitle”),
    3) **a mention of the credits** (with data source, mapper's name, #30DayMapChallenge) and
    4) **the Rbanism logo** whenever possible.
3. Create a **folder** whose title is “*challengedate_challengetopic”,* containing:
    1) **the data whenever possible** (as small as possible),
    2) **R code**,
    3) **PNG of the map**, and
    4) **<200 words describing the content of the map** & **<200 words describing the process and what you learned**.

See our examples [here](https://github.com/Rbanism/30DayMapChallenge2024/tree/main/8Nov_HDX) and [here](https://github.com/Rbanism/30DayMapChallenge2024/tree/main/15Nov_MyData).

5. **Send the zipped folder to [rbanism@tudelft.nl](mailto:rbanism@tudelft.nl)** or 2) **send a Pull Request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Rbanism/30DayMapChallenge2024)** *at least one day before the date of your topic.*

**If you want your author credits to be shared on our social media, please share your instagram/BlueSky handle with the submission! If via email, simply add it to the mail, if via GitHub, please add a .txt file within the folder.*
