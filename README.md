# 30DayMapChallenge2025

The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) is an event which gathers mappers on social media each November since 2019. The challenge is to produce a map for each of the 30 days of November, following the set of themes / topics / constraints set by the organisers.

This year again, we participate as a group to the #30DayMapChallenge. Given the focus of the Rbanism community on the programming language R, we create each map with R.
