Day 15 - FIRE: Finance, Insurance, Real Estate and other advanced services as markers of urban globalisation
By Clémentine Cottineau-Mugadza

**Content Description**
This map represents the relative connectivity of cities, based on the intra-company flows of global service firms in 2020. The Globalisation and World Cities (GaWC) group at Loughborough University, and B. Derruder and P.J. Taylor in particular, have developed and refined this method for ranking world cities since the 2000s. It assumes that the location strategies of firms and their subsidiaries creates a network of knowledge and financial flows between cities connected that way, which is a good marker of urban globalisation. Although the map is crowded with >700 cities, labels highlight the cities which have a global connectivity level of at least 55\% of the most connected city (e.g. London). These world cities, mostly from the global North, are in positions of power and control over the globalised economy.


**Process Description**
To make this map, I had to geolocate the list of cities provided by the GaWC, reproject the geospatial layers into the Bonne project for a nice world view, and create a plot of city according to their relative connectivities. I chose to filter cities which were labelled to make the map more legible.
