Day 7 - Accessibility. A Matter of Means

By Inès Zaid

Content Description: This map interprets accessibility from an infrastructural, geographic and economic standpoint. It seeks to intersect these domains in the context of England, which presents a high level of disparity between the areas that have affluence *and* access to mobility, and the areas that do not. 
It also puts into light the erosion in the railway network left decades after the Beeching Cuts, particularly prevalent in the Midlands. To illustrate further these inequalities, I zoomed in on Leicester and London. On the one hand, Leicester, which was once a industrial revolution powerhouse, appears as mostly economically deprived and has a single point of access to the railway network. On the other hand, London is a mosaic of levels of affluence, and has a web of access to mobility. This map aims to highlights the correlation between deprivation and national mobility in a compelling way.

Process description: To create this map, I leverage the newly released dataset of IMD (2025) representing the level of deprivation in England, and intersect it with ONS boundaries data, parsed only for England data. Similarly, I filtered the NaPTAN dataset to only show major train stations. I created two boxes to zoom in two contrasting English cities, placing them on the side of the newly obtained National Map. I got to play with new functions to make the map as compelling in its representation, showing access to transport as lights points. I also learned how to combine several objects in a single plot, including the logo which was surprisingly challenging.
