## Description of the map
This map illustrates the reforestation process of the Loess Plateau in north-central China. The primary indicator of change is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands of satellite imagery.\
Situated along the Yellow River, the Loess Plateau was once the heartland of ancient Chinese civilization. However, over the past three millennia, extensive soil erosion has led to severe deforestation and ecological degradation.\
Large-scale restoration efforts began in the 1960s, with the most notable transformations occurring in the past two decades. The map visualizes this remarkable ecological recovery, highlighting the shift in vegetation cover between 1985 and 2020.


## Reflection
**On Data**\
The satellite imagery used in this map comes from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, which provide an excellent archive for examining historical land cover changes. While expanding the study area would offer a broader perspective, the large size of raster datasets makes processing considerably slower and more computationally demanding.\
**On Map Display**\
One major limitation of this map is the absence of a scale bar, which makes it difficult to grasp the actual size of the area being shown.
