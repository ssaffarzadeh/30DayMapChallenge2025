# 3 November - Polygons: Destruction Patterns in Gaza

## Content of the Map

This map shows the spatial distribution of buildings that were destroyed or severely damaged in the Gaza Strip up to 11 October 2025, illustrating the intensity and geographic pattern of recent attacks. The building-level damage data were sourced from UNOSAT’s Damage Assessment program and aggregated at the block level, highlighting clusters of destruction across different urban areas. Overlaying the extracted data on administrative block polygons allows for aggregation at a meaningful spatial unit for planning, humanitarian assessment, and risk analysis. Additional layers, such as evacuation zones and overall area extent, provide contextual information, situating the damage within the broader urban and geographic framework of Gaza. The map serves both as a record of destruction and as a tool to support disaster response planning, emergency resource allocation, and post-conflict reconstruction prioritization. By visualizing patterns of damage, it highlights areas most affected by recent attacks and potential spatial disparities in destruction, offering a foundation for further quantitative analyses or integration with social and infrastructural datasets.

## Process

The construction of the map followed a multi-step geospatial workflow combining satellite-derived damage data with administrative boundary data. First, UNOSAT’s damage assessment dataset, which provides building-level classifications of destruction and severe damage, was downloaded and pre-processed. Pre-processing involved cleaning the dataset, standardizing attribute fields, and filtering for the relevant destroyed and severely damaged buildings up to 11 October 2025. In parallel, the Gaza Strip block and evacuation zones polygons were prepared to serve as the spatial framework for aggregation and visualization. The relevant features were extracted from the UNOSAT dataset and aggregated by block polygons using GIS operations, enabling the assignment of damage counts to each block. The map was then developed in R using the `ggplot2` and `sf` libraries, with additional visualization layers for water, land, extent, and evacuation zones to enhance contextual understanding.

To represent the number of destroyed or severely damaged buildings per block, the aggregated data were classified using **Jenks natural breaks**, producing a map that highlights meaningful spatial patterns of destruction. The code is flexible and allows the use of alternative classification methods (e.g., equal intervals, quantiles) depending on analytical or visualization needs.

Styling decisions, such as color palettes for destruction classes, white outlines for evacuation zones, and dark background for contrast, were applied to maximize readability and interpretability. The resulting map integrates high-resolution damage data with administrative geography to produce a clear, reproducible, and informative visual representation suitable for both analytical and communicative purposes.
