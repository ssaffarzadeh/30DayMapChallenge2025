Periurban Intensities

## Content Description

This map is our attempt to summarise the peri-urban provision of the range of amenities considered providing for essential needs. For each cell we count the number of dominant amenities from 9 categories to characterise the diversity of amenities in those places. The resulting values range from 0 (none, absence of dominant amenities) to 9 (all, maximum diversity). The size of the squares is given by that count.

## Process Description

The main challenge of this map was choosing a simple way of visualising the intensity of diversity of amenities. What started as a complex plan in which each grid cell would display a categorised value of each amenity, ended up as the simple count described above. While this is an effective way to summarise the diversity of amenities spatially, the process of producing this map inspired us to develop non-spatial visualisations that can provide more insight into the multiple dimensions of the peri-urban conditions investigated in the InPUT project.
