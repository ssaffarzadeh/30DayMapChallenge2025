Periurban Intensities

## Content Description

This map is our attempt to summarise a peri-urban condition characterised by a large number of variables. Each cell is characterised by a demographic typology (resulting from clustering multiple demographic variables) and a spatial typology (resulting from clustering multiple spatial-morphological variables). Moreover, for each combination of demographic and spatial types, we count the number of dominant amenities from 9 categories to characterise the diversity of amenities in those types. The resulting values range from 0 (none, absence of dominant amenities) to 9 (all, maximum diversity). The size of the squares is given by that count.

## Process Description

The main challenge of this map was the combination of a large number of variables and choosing a
