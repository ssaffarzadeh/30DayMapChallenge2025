Periurban Intensities

## Content Description

This map is our attempt to summarise a peri-urban condition characterised by a large number of variables. Each cell is characterised by a demographic typology (resulting from clustering multiple demographic variables) and a spatial typology (resulting from clustering multiple spatial-morphological variables). Moreover, for each combination of demographic and spatial types, we count the number of dominant amenities from 9 categories to characterise the diversity of amenities in those types. The resulting values range from 0 (none, absence of dominant amenities) to 9 (all, maximum diversity). The size of the squares is given by that count.

## Process Description

The main challenge of this map was choosing a simple way to visualise a large number of variables. What started as a complex plan in which each grid cell would display a categorised value of each amenity, ended up as the simple count described above. While this is an effective way to summarise the diversity of amenities spatially, the process of producing this map inspired us to develop non-spatial visualisations that can provide more insight into the multiple dimensions of the periurban conditions investigated in the InPUT project.
